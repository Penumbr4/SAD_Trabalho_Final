Sinds 2015 ben ik trotse eigenares van dit stadsappartement op de perfecte locatie!
Met mijn partner en baby samen ga ik binnenkort verhuizen naar een buitenwijk van Rotterdam omdat dit mooie stadsappartement gewoonweg te klein is om met z'n 3en in te blijven wonen.
Omdat ik in het verleden jarenlang dit appartement heb verhuurd via o.a. Airbnb, wil ik dat nu opnieuw doen voor een tijdje.
Dit keer is mijn gehele appartement beschikbaar via Airbnb, voorheen woonde ik er zelf ook en tegelijkertijd verhuurde ik een kamer voor 2 personen.

Ik woon, werk en studeer(de) in Rotterdam.
Sinds 2015 werk ik als zelfstandig Recruiter, Relatiemanager en Sollicitatiecoach.
Wat ik erg leuk vind aan mijn werk is het dagelijks schakelen met een diversiteit aan mensen en nationaliteiten op verschillende niveaus.

Naast dat er veel tijd gaat naar mijn lieve baby (dreumes alweer), besteed ik graag tijd aan surfen, mijn familie en vrienden, muziek volleybal, hardlopen en nieuwe plekken ontdekken.
Mijn favoriete muziek is Reggae; ik kan geen dag zonder!

Voor mij is deze plek de ideale plek van wonen; midden in het centrum, alles op loop- en fietsafstand. Ik ervaar hier het ultieme stadsgevoel met nog een beetje groen om mij heen!
Mijn appartement bevindt zich op de topetage waardoor je de hele dag kunt genieten van een mooi uitzicht.

Thanks for looking into my profile! :)
I am a 31 year old Dutch guy, living in the heart of Rotterdam. As I'm writing this (February 2017), I have used Airbnb only for my own travels. In March that will change. I will visit Peru for a month and I'd be happy to let my apartment be of use for you! I am quite thrilled about this trip, as I've never been to South America before and heard great stories about it.

When I am not travelling, I work as a coach for people who depend on a social benefit for their income and have a very long distance to the labour market. I try to help them to work on their problems by coaching them and by connecting them to the right professionals, projects and organizations. Besides work, I like to hang out with friends, travel, run, cycle, go to the gym and play football.",within an hour,100%,60%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-117247688/original/474483cd-2fba-4136-88ad-2005426b70b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-117247688/original/474483cd-2fba-4136-88ad-2005426b70b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Rotterdam, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands",Cs Kwartier,Rotterdam Centrum,51.92512,4.4663,Entire condo,Entire home/apt,3,,1 bath,2,2,"[""Hair dryer"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Iron"", ""Wifi"", ""Free washer \u2013 In unit"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Essentials"", ""Hangers"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Heating"", ""TV"", ""Shampoo""]",$150.00,3,60,1,3,1125,1125,3.0,1125.0,,t,0,0,0,33,2023-09-18,14,3,0,2017-03-31,2023-07-10,4.64,4.93,4.64,5.0,4.93,4.93,4.79,LT723780000009713789,f,1,1,0,0,0.18

Als ik thuis ben en mijn koffie drink kijk ik graag naar de vrachtschepen die voorbij varen. Dit geeft mij het gevoel in een havenstad te wonen.
Ik maak graag wandelingen door de stad en drink mijn biertje in toeristisch Delfshaven wat 5 min lopen van mijn huis ligt. 
Hier ligt veel geschiedenis van de stad. Vanuit deze plek is Rotterdam min of meer uitgebouwd. Het is daar rustig en mooi. Het lijkt een beetje op Amsterdam met zijn grachten en pakhuiswoningen.

Ik ben een creatief persoon en ben graag fysiek bezig.
In mijn B&B zul je de sfeer van creativiteit kunnen proeven.
De inrichting van heel mijn huis heb ik in de stijl van het huis wat in 1924 gebouwd is. Bovendien is het een bewuste keuze om te recycelen.

Naast mijn benb vind ik het heerlijk om in mijn tuin te tuinieren.  Ik schilder graag en maak tassen. 
Ik help anderen hun huis te reorganiseren en opknappen.
Dus u zou mij in kluskleding aan kunnen treffen ;-)

I am Saskia, single, lawyer. I have been living and working in Rotterdam for about 30 years. In July 2015 I bought the apartment in the Timmerhuis (casco), and I moved in at the end of 2015. 
I live there with a lot of pleasure! The location is fantastic, I have very nice neighbors and the apartment itself has everything I could want. But the terraces are my pride and joy, and also the main reason for buying the apartment. I have what you call in Dutch ""green fingers.""

Because of a major leak, which fortunately has now been fixed, I was unable to accept bookings for a year.  This was followed by the Covid pandemic. 

I look forward to hearing your experiences!

A few of the finest bars and discotheques are in 5 minute walking distance and the city is a 10 minute walk! Where you find even more places to party or have dinner or a drink. 

I hope my house is a place where you feel comfortable, welcome and most of all inspired. 

Hope  to see you soon!

Ik ben geen veeleisende bewoner en zal goed met uw spullen omgaan. 

Mijn stijl van reizen is low budget, ik maak graag gebruik van hostels en dergelijke, kamperen is echter niet mijn stijl. Ik kom graag in contact met plaatselijke bewoners om te horen hoe zij hun leven ervaren en hun mening te horen over deze wereld.

In het verleden heb ik op diverse reizen naar Zuid-Afrika ook vrijwilligerswerk gedaan (samen met één van mijn dochters) in de townships van Port Elizabeth. Ik vind het belangrijk om te proberen mijn steentje bij te dragen in de leefbaarheid voor andere mensen op onze aarde 

Mijn hobby's zijn lezen, handwerken, reizen met mijn kinderen en mijn werk op de klantenservice van een energiebedrijf.

I prefer an affordable accommodation spot above a hotel, because of the homey atmosphere and the opportunity to get to know any other people. I'm not a demanding occupant and will properly handle your belongings.

My style of travel is low budget , I like to use hostels and such , camping is not my style. I like to come in contact with local residents to hear how they experience their lives and hear their views on the world.

In the past I have also volunteered on several trips to South Africa (along with one of my daughters) in the townships of Port Elizabeth. I think it's important to try to do my part in the quality of life for other people on earth

Welcome to my page. My name is Jolie. I'm a clinical psychologist who moved to Rotterdam 7 years ago. I'm the first owner of my loft and have designed the interior myself with great care. I enjoy living here very much. After some nice experiences with Airbnb as a guest, I decided it would be selfish to keep my spare bedroom all to myself, especially since it has such a great view of the Rotterdam skyline. I live with my dachshund Laika, but she doesn't talk back very much. That's another reason why I've decided to make my guest bedroom available on Airbnb. In the evening I am mostly home and always open to a nice conversation, or to just hang out. But please don't feel obliged, as I know very well how nice it can be to retreat in a nice private room when travelling.

The motivational factor is ofcourse the money but in the end this should hopefully not be a merely financial transaction.

In Hoek van Holland an old German telephone bunker has been transformed in to a holiday home for two adults and two children.<br /><br />You will be staying in the nature reserve and national monument ‘Vinetaduin’. Beneath these dunes lie about 70 bunkers that originate from four layers of military history of the 20th century.  The telephone bunker lies in the northern part, near the villa district and entrance to the beach.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />For the transformation of the telephone bunker, we collaborated with progressive designers and builders. They gave the bunker a new peaceful function and worked with as much ecological and circular material as possible. This way you come in contact with contemporary designers and sustainable building techniques during your stay.<br />The bunker now has: <br />- underground bedroom for two adults (1.90m high)<br />- box bed for one adult or two children (190 x 134cm)<br />- ","The town of Hoek van Holland originates from digging the Nieuwe Waterweg in 1872. In the following century, thousands of defenses were built on both banks to defend this new channel. These influences have been decisive in shaping the landscape of ‘the Hook of Holland’. Even today, the Hook is continuously subject to the influence of Rotterdam and the North Sea. If you pay close attention, you will notice this everywhere.

Welcome at my page!:)
My name is Mirjam, I'm a Dutchie, in daily life I'm a social worker. In my spare time I love to visit new places, nature, singing, a sucker for good coffee,  going out for walks,  try to play guitar ( with the emphasis on 'try'), do my best to give some love to my plants, like to cook and ofcourse... traveling!

Since I was young I already liked traveling.  I remember my family and I were traveling by campervan. Such a joy we had. I continued traveling when I got older. I've been to countries within Europe, but also outside Europe, like: the US, Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil, Curacaõ, Laoh and Thailand.  I've stayed more than a year in Thailand where I've worked on voluntary base as a counselor. 

When I travel I would like to have that feeling of 'home'. That's why I  love to host and to give my guests that feeling of 'home' as well. 

That feeling of traveling and meeting new people, makes me come alive. 
So why not meeting new people, travelers, in my city Rotterdam?

I hope to get to know you a bit as well:)

I am Joost, I live in Rotterdam and I love to travel and explore the world for work as for pleasure. That's why I can sometimes rent out my cosy apartment in the centre of Rotterdam. Throughout my travelling career I have always used Rotterdam as my base. This is the city where I grew up, studied and most of my family & friends live whom I meet up with for dinner & drinks in the weekend. I hope you will enjoy Rotterdam as much I do. The city has a great vibe with lots of contemporary architectonical buildings and cool bars. In the street of my apartment are many bars and restaurants to be found. I hope you will enjoy yourself. 

Cheers,
Joost

Welcome to my page. My name is Jolie. I'm a clinical psychologist who moved to Rotterdam 7 years ago. I'm the first owner of my loft and have designed the interior myself with great care. I enjoy living here very much. After some nice experiences with Airbnb as a guest, I decided it would be selfish to keep my spare bedroom all to myself, especially since it has such a great view of the Rotterdam skyline. I live with my dachshund Laika, but she doesn't talk back very much. That's another reason why I've decided to make my guest bedroom available on Airbnb. In the evening I am mostly home and always open to a nice conversation, or to just hang out. But please don't feel obliged, as I know very well how nice it can be to retreat in a nice private room when travelling.

I am a passionate traveler and Airbnb guest/superhost, having been in the industry for years. I understand the importance of a great experience for both myself and my hosts and strive to make my stays as comfortable, clean, and accurate as possible. Originally from the Netherlands, I have lived in several countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States, and Argentina, and now call Copenhagen, Denmark my home. 

When it comes to travel, I love to experience different cultures and local lifestyles, and I truly appreciate the conversations and interactions I get to have with hosts and other guests. I am not very needy, but I do expect the accommodation to be as described. In my free time, I enjoy photography, scuba diving, aviation and cultural visits.
